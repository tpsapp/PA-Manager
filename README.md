I created this application as an attempt to understand how the Prison Architect Save Game Structure
is layed out. It allows you to edit the preferences for the game itself and also edit the informationn
for each individual save game. I am working to add other features to it such as being able to edit the
guards, prisoners, and map. This is a side project I am working on as a learning experience so it may
not be updated that frequently. Currently it is updated for the Alpha-12 version of Prison Architect.
